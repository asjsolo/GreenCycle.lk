GreenCycle.lk - 
Plastic Awareness and Sustainability Platform

Lack of proper plastic waste management is damaging the environment. People use plastic in daily life without realizing its long-term impact on rivers, seas and communities. While some individuals and organizations promote sustainability, many consumers lack awareness, knowledge, and motivation to reduce their plastic consumption. There is a need for a digital platform that educates users about plastic waste, calculates their plastic footprint, and provides actionable steps toward sustainability.

The GreenCycle.lk platform is an innovative web application designed to tackle this gap. It aims to empower users by providing them with the knowledge, tools, and motivation to reduce their plastic footprint. The users can track, reduce, recycle, and earn rewards for proper plastic disposal. The platform will feature a Plastic Footprint Calculator to help users measure their plastic usage, an Awareness Hub with educational resources on sustainable alternatives, a Community Forum where users can share ideas, participate in challenges, and collaborate on plastic reduction initiatives, a Recycling Directory where they can find recycling centers close to their place for proper recycling of plastics, and an Analytical Dashboard where their eco-friendly actions can be tracked, and its analytics can be viewed to increase their motivation.
